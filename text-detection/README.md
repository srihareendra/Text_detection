Text Detection on Android Devices
=================================


1. Install Android SDK, NDK, and OpenCV for Android. Tutorials can be found (http://opencv.itseez.com/doc/tutorials/introduction/android_binary_package/android_binary_package.html) and (http://opencv.itseez.com/doc/tutorials/introduction/android_binary_package/android_binary_package_using_with_NDK.html#android-binary-package-with-ndk).
2. Set up an `OPENCV_PACKAGE_DIR` environment variable with the path of your Android OpenCV directory and an `OPENCV_CAMERA_MODULES` environment variable with the value `off`.
